# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Useful Links

-   **UI Design** - Open [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/nZn3yKH8VjBbJlaZ7jdyQK/SINFO-Workshop?node-id=0%3A1) to view the design specs
-   **Github Repo** - Open...
-   **Codesandbox** - Open...

## Setup

### No-Setup Setup (recommended)

You should be able to go through the workshop in the browser, wich requires no setup. Go to this codesandbox and click `Fork` (in the top right corner).

### Local Setup

If you'd prefer to work through the workshop on your computer, follow the instructions on this section.
Please keep in mind the workshop time is very limited and if you have issues with this setup, you should opt by the Codesandbox alternative.

#### System Requirements

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) v2 or greater
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v10 or greater
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) v6 or greater

To verify if these are properly set up, run the following commands:

```
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

#### Clone project

If all the above requirements are met, run the following commands to clone and start the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/LINK
cd sinfo-workshop
npm start
```

Note: If you want to commit and push your work as you go, you'll want to fork first and then clone your fork rather than this repo directly.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
